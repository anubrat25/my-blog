# Hi, I'm Anubrat ðŸ‘‹

Born almost eight thousand days ago. Right now, I'm a junior year, Computer Science student at Manipal Academy of Higher Education.

I genuinely love exploring Data Science and AI, as they offer mathematical insights. I enjoy experimenting with new ideas and techniques to solve complex problems. If I'm not working on a project, you might find me reading or writing something new.

If you want to get in touch, I'm most responsive over [email](mailto:anubratbora25@gmail.com) and I tend to be pretty active on [Twitter](https://x.com/anubrat25) as well.
PREVIOUSLY

Most recently, I worked on building chatbots as a Machine Learning Engineer at Nexus Info, an early-stage startup in Chennai, TN, India. Before that, I was a Backend Development Trainee at Tech Savvy Software & Security Consultancy in Guwahati, AS, India. I graduated high school from Vivekananda Kendra Vidyalaya, Golaghat, AS, India, completing both my 10th and 12th grades. I have always had a strong inclination toward mathematics and problem-solving, which continues to this day. I'm enjoying my engineering studies as a Computer Science student and hope to collaborate with startups on various projects.
