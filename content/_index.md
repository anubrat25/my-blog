> "Behind every great man, there is a woman rolling her eyes." – Jim Carrey


Welcome to my corner of creativity. 

I'm Anubrat, and I am lost—lost in perfection, still chasing it. In this pursuit, I created *Astral Alchemy* to find just that. Alongside my love for writing, I'm captivated by math and computer science, leaving my brain in a constant tug-of-war between logic and existential crises. After years of procrastination, bad decisions, and hourly dramatic sighs, I’ve finally taken the leap. Whether it soars or crash-lands—well, we’ll find out.

My goal here is to bring my ideas to life and ensure my musings (mostly) make sense.
