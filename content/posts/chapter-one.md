This is *Althea* and I welcome you all.

I've always wanted to start my own blog, and thanks to the support of some of my favorite people, I finally have. This site isn’t just a collection of posts; it's a collection of my life's highs and lows.  

It’s mostly satirical, much like my life. Through it, I’ll share my boring little adventures. I’m incredibly grateful to each of you reading this. Certain aspects may not be perfect since I’m still figuring things out, so bear with me.  

Now, buckle up! You’re about to dive into the pages of *Althea*. Fingers crossed you won’t hate me on the other side.

With no license and a questionable sense of direction, this is your pilot,

Anubrat.
