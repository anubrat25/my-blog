This is *Astral Alchemy* and I welcome you all.

I have always wanted to start my blogging site. And thanks to all the support from some of my favourite people I have finally been able to. This site is more than just a collection of posts; it's a book of my life's fun & tragedy.

It's mostly satirical, so is my life. That way, I shall share my boring little life. I extend my gratitude to each one of you reading this. Certain aspects might not be perfect as I’m still new to this, but please do bear with me.

So, buckle up! You are about to dive into the pages of *Astral Alchemy*. Fingers crossed, you won’t hate me on the other side.

With no license and a questionable sense of direction, this is your pilot,

Anubrat.
