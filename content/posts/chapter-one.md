This is Astral Alchemy and I welcome you all.

I have always wanted to start my blogging site. And thanks to all the support from some of my favourite people I have finally been able to. I’m filled with a sense of wonder and anticipation. This site is more than just a collection of posts; it's a canvas where memories of my life gets painted.

Through space & time, I’m taking you all in this journey where I shall share my boring little life. As we embark on this adventure, I extend my gratitude to each of you for being a part of this cosmic journey and be patient enough to read about the things I write. Certain aspects might not be perfect as I’m still new to this, but please do bear with me.

So, buckle up on the starship. The stars await us, and the pages of Astral Alchemy are ready to be inscribed with magic.

With cosmic dust and wonder, this is your pilot,

Anubrat.
