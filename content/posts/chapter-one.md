Welcome again!

I've always wanted to start my own blog, and thanks to the support of some of my favorite people, I finally have. This site isn’t just about posts, it's about the (*occasional*) randomness of my life.  

It’s mostly satirical, much like my existence. Through it, I’ll share the boring *little things* in my life and learning. I’m incredibly grateful to each of you reading this. Some things may not be perfect since I’m still figuring things out, so *bear with me*.  

Cheers,

Anubrat.
