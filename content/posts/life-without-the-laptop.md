A family trip was long due. Bags packed! All checked! And so I headed with zeal. Not long after I was stopped at security because of my creatine. I was pissed. But, but... the MESSI BURGER had made up for it.

Your parents treat you so well, atleast they do for the first 10 minutes on seeing you after 3 months.

And man, I gotta agree, Rajasthani food's great, even better than the monuments, perhaps?

Post the sightseeing part, and my problem of getting bored quickly, we came, as always I ordered food, we ate and we slept. Next day, we went to the Taj, and surely, I meant the Mahal, common on!

Though, I realized, life could be fun without the laptop as well. And it's worth spending time with people, also ordering food online, listening to music online, and booking tickets online as well.

Nights were amazing... lovely music + best food, could it get any better?

To end it all, we bought stuff, lots of stuff! (Bought too many souvenirs, just to see my Paytm go red.)

Time for return, back to the hostel. The T2, Bangalore airport at night is a different monument of its own.

Maybe, just maybe, vacations are a good thing until it's forced. Can't wait for the next one! 

See you soon.
