The end of my third semester marked the culmination of weeks of late-night study sessions, stress, and hard work. As I completed my last end semester exam (I had Object Oriented Programming as my last exam. And man, I hated Java!), I felt an overwhelming sense of relief and accomplishment. Little did I know that this would be the beginning of a series of heartwarming moments that would make my holidays truly special. I’d changed my flight ticket as I was convinced to surprise my brother. Shoutout to my friend Aniket, thanks for convincing me. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. The unexpected reunion set the tone for a holiday season filled with love and happiness.

Everyone’s aware of how horrible mess food in college really is. After so many days, we ordered so much food late that night, I finally ate happily. And yes, I know it’s the company that matters more. And yes, I do completely agree. (Before anyone starts arguing)

Next day came, and I was excited to see my parents. I had to take the bus and so I did. I reached home at around 9 PM. Ma had made dinner. I’ve always teased Ma about how horrible her food is. (Which I still believe, of course), but that dinner, OH MY GOD! it was delicious! I’m finally what I should’ve been before, GRATEFUL.

To be honest, yes, I do miss home at times (definitely till the point Ma starts shouting). I resumed gym and I finally became happy (even though temporarily). Seriously, gym is the best thing if you’ve become stressed from your life and are looking for some peace.

The next day meant 11th December and guess what? It was my parents’ anniversary. My brother and I had order a set of perfumes for them. On giving them their gift, they immediately liked it, followed by that awkward hug. Then it was time to meet my friends and yes, her too. (Kidding! Or am I?) Anyway, I met all of them, and it was so refreshing to see them. Everyone’s fighting their own battles, how fun!

It’s Christmas Day! And everything is just so perfect. San‘TA’ has brought us sweets and gifts (as always). Interestingly enough, I’ve put lights around our front porch this time around and the fun part was our neighbours assumed that we got ourselves converted. We had played some fantastic cricket matches.

I can’t elaborate enough as even the most amazing words won’t be able to describe the swing that one of friends got on the day.

The fun didn’t stop though, what followed next was epic cinema! It has become one of the most exhilarating matches ever, our Thala conceded 20 runs in the final over, and we ended up losing the match, it was the first time that a 50 plus score was chased in a 6 overs game. Courtesy - Chik Chik.

Hey, “Things I’m grateful for” List, please add “Finally able to watch a movie together with my brother”. It was cringe, but worth it. (Why won’t it be? I danced) And oh, could you also add “A Small Family Trip”, It was fun too, wherever we went, we saw many picnic groups around.

Never imagined that a morning car ride to an unknown planet could be so much fun. Looking back, I can finally say that we did make some great memories. I still can’t explain the way those people were staring, and it makes me laugh every time.

True joy is when you come home during holidays and everyone invites you for dinners. And after everything, how can I now not talk about everything? I don’t wanna mention, but yes, some magic happened. I became happy, FINALLY!

It was a full circle, I went back to my brother’s and we had a great dinner again (We always do), as the holiday season drew to a close, I found myself reflecting on the wonderful moments that had defined this special time. The realisation that I would soon be returning to college brought a mix of emotions. While excited about the opportunities and experiences that awaited me, the prospect of leaving home left a bittersweet taste. But in the moment, I enjoyed everyone’s company. Thank you, everyone & everything.

P.S. - Now, I realise how gracefully we’ve grown. To parents, we’re kids. But in the vastness of this life, in the world, we’re merely an one in 8 billion and shall continue this rush, but the comfort that our homes provide at times when we need it the most, is priceless. Again, this is ONLY at times.
