This is abut the end of my third semester, which marked the end of weeks of late-night study sessions, stress, and hard work (Also ordering late night food). I had Object Oriented Programming as my last exam. And man, I hated Java! I felt a  sense of genuine relief and accomplishment, after a long time.

I wanted my holidays to be special, so I decided to to surprise my younger brother. And all the food that he Swiggy'd on seeing me told me it was worth it.

That night, the dinner at home felt great after that long. I’m finally what I should’ve been before, GRATEFUL.

Gym is a form of escapism, and rightly so, I proved it during the holidays.

Next day, guests had come, well (don't tell them) but usually I am not very welcoming, but this time, I felt ~~good~~ fine. And I believe it was because of this.

25th, The Christmas Day! And everything wass just so perfect. San‘TA’ had brought us sweets and gifts (as always). Interestingly enough, I’ve put lights around our front porch this time around. Funnily enough, the neighbours though we had changed religion.

Hey, “Things I’m grateful for” list, please add “Finally able to watch a movie together with my brother”. Never imagined that a morning car ride to an unknown planet could be so much fun. True joy is when you come home during holidays and everyone invites you for dinners.

And after everything, how can I now not talk about my everything? I don’t wanna mention, but yes, something unexpectedly great happened. Thus, MAGIC HAPPENED!

See you soon.
