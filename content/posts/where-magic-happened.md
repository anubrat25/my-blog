This is about the end of my third semester, which marked the end of weeks of late-night study sessions, stress, and hard work (*also, ordering late-night food*). I had Object Oriented Programming as my last exam. And man, I hated Java! I felt a  sense of genuine relief and accomplishment after a long time.

I wanted my holidays to be special, so I decided to surprise my younger brother. And all the food he Swiggy'd after seeing me told me it was worth it.

The next night, dinner at home felt great after so long. I was finally what I shouldâ€™ve been before, GRATEFUL.

Gym is a form of escapism, and rightly so, I proved it during the holidays.

The next day, guests came over. Well (don't tell them), but usually, I'm not very welcoming. This time, tough, I felt ~~good~~ fine. And I believe it was because of this.

25th, The Christmas Day! And everything was just so perfect. San(Ta) had brought us sweets and gifts (as always). Interestingly enough, I put lights around our front porch this time. *Funnily enough, the neighbors thought we had changed religion.*

Additionally, that morning car ride to an *unknown planet altogether* was something else.

Christmas time's fun. I enjoy winter. Guess magic really happens... and wishes do come true.

See you soon.
