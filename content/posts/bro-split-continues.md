I have gained, not memories, not grades, but weight. Fat, you say? I say it's bulking.

It's been a long time. Well, it's more like an update. Basically, college has been the same, and the pressure of getting an internship is really catching up to me. The countless happy posts on LinkedIn aren't helping either. And lately, sending out applications on (almost) all job platforms feels like a waste of time.

One constant? Man, I've become obsessed with the gym. More like escapism? I don't know. Have you ever seen those guys on the internet who tell you to become the ULTIMATE version of yourself? Me neither. But people tell me I'm trying to be one. I remember when watching movies and shows was fun, when it didn’t leave me with any regret.

Is it a good thing, though? I mean, I ain't enjoying it.

You promise yourself to be productive, and the same night, you end up spending hours chilling with your friends on the balcony, talking and self-roasting.

Nights are always *fun*. Right, people?

These are the same friends who try their hardest to convince me to go on a trip with them (*sooo forced*) and argue that it would be their *last*. The only issue? You’ll soon see another "*last*" trip being planned the next weekend, then another after that, and the cycle continues...

Clock's ticking... placements are coming. And night ponderings somehow manage to take the stress away.

Let’s see where I land.

See you soon.
