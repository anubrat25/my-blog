Just like Weekend at Barnie's, my third semester has been a mixed bag but one thing that I’ve been enjoying the most are my perfect weekends. All thanks to the amazing group of friends that I have. (No puns, none at all)

Without you, weekends are just days you get for extra sleep, which is bad? Ah, anyway... the concept of a perfect weekend often varies from person to person, shaped by individual preferences. And for me, this weekend rocked! Let me elaborate.

The weekend kicked off with me being excited and waking up on my own (trust me when I say this, it doesn’t usually happen by itself), I believe it was because of the Champions League final that we had to play. As always, I was the who had to gather everyone. With promises to myself that it was the last time I do that, we started playing. After a couple of injuries we ended and headed for mess food, a mediocre breakfast.

See this? I gave my everything to completing my projects and assignments, and so did chatGPT.

Post this, I just slept and slept... (why won't I? Had you seen me, you would've said the same.

And Bangalore being unpredictable, showed it's true colors in the form of heavy downpours. Seriously this city's a mess, but what do I say to my relatives when being asked about the city? Yes. "The weather's awesome!", [Rahul Subramanian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVrtI6YOe6Y&ab_channel=RandomChikibum), I feel you.

As the rain stopped, it was time for IND vs AUS. And truly, the thrill of the game, the highs and lows, and the annoying desires of my friends to see the 11th man finish the game for India were in a way INTERESTING. It was an exhilarating experience honestly as the screen was really great and bright, maybe too bright too, it was as if I were in the stadium.

All good, India won, we walked on tracks making fun of one another. Bullying. But the best part. It was after I came back to my block, and sat on the balcony, with some friends and we shared thoughts-too dark and complex to be revealed, some against the law too. Accompanied by a playlist of old Soft Rock, we enjoyed the night, and the weekend. No happy ending as Monday followed.
