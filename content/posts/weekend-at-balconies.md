Just like Weekend at Barnie's, my third semester has been a mixed bag but one thing that I’ve been enjoying the most are my perfect weekends. Lovely people, I wanna take you through one such. My Perfect Weekend: Morning Football to Rainy Evenings. Shoutout to the amazing group of college friends I have. Without you, weekends are just days you get for extra sleep. (I swear no pun has been intended)

The concept of a perfect weekend often varies from person to person, shaped by individual preferences and activities that bring joy and relaxation. For me, a recent weekend perfectly encapsulated what I consider to be the ideal two days of leisure and enjoyment. From the early morning rush of a football game to the tranquil late-night moments spent on my balcony, it was a weekend filled with the things that bring me the most happiness.

The weekend kicked off with me being excited and waking up on my own (trust me when I say this, it doesn’t usually happen by itself), signalling the beginning of a day that promised excitement and camaraderie. As the sun rose, I gathered with friends to play football on the turf. The cool morning breeze, the laughter, and the friendly competition set a positive tone for the rest of the weekend. The satisfaction of a morning well spent on the field is truly irreplaceable.

Following the exhilarating game, I decided to indulge in one of my favourite weekend treats: ordering food (Swiggy to the rescue, again, as always). A tasty meal that felt like a well-deserved reward for the hard work put into the morning match.

Well, it won’t be my original writing without me talking about the boring stuff. With a satisfied stomach and a burst of energy, I delved into working on my research paper. While academic responsibilities are not everyone's idea of a perfect weekend, there is a unique sense of fulfilment in making progress and pursuing one's intellectual passions. The quiet hours of focused research reminded me of the importance of balancing study and play.

As the afternoon turned into evening, with me sleeping most of the time, the rain began to fall (again, Bangalore is too unpredictable). The silver lining is that there is always something undeniably soothing about the gentle patter of raindrops against the window. It's as though the world outside is taking a break, and I decided to do the same. I called up some friends, and we spent hours on the phone, sharing stories and laughter. Even though we couldn't be together in person, it was a reminder of the strength of our bonds and the importance of nurturing friendships and love.

Later in the evening, I settled down to watch a cricket match, it was IND vs AUS. The thrill of the game, the highs and lows, and the sense of unity that comes with being part of a global fan base were truly captivating. It was an exhilarating experience as if I were in the stadium.

It was so fun, my friends and I cracked so many jokes. And oh, words of advice, too many poor dark jokes with friends ain’t good, makes you put humour in normal conversations and makes you dark (other one, not the sunburn thing).

As the night grew darker, I retreated to my balcony, accompanied by a playlist of my favorite songs (mostly old songs). The world outside was washed in the soft glow of streetlights and the mesmerising sound of rain. In that moment, I realised how much beauty there is in the world, even on the precipice of another workweek. The music and the view combined to create a perfect ambiance that was both calming and invigorating.

Inevitably, the weekend came to an end, and Monday loomed on the horizon. But it was a weekend filled with elements that made it absolutely perfect for me. The combination of physical activity, delicious food, academic pursuits, meaningful conversations, sports, and moments of reflection created a well-rounded experience that encapsulated the essence of a balanced and fulfilling life. These are the weekends that we cherish, the ones that remind us to appreciate the simple joys and the bonds that enrich our lives.

P.S. - College friends are a huge part of the college experience. They’re the ones who support you through the highs and lows of academics, share unforgettable moments, and bring different perspectives that help you grow. These friendships don’t just end after college—they turn into lifelong connections, offering both emotional support and professional networking opportunities. Whether it’s late-night study sessions, spontaneous adventures, or just having someone to lean on, college friends make the journey more meaningful, fun, and fulfilling.
