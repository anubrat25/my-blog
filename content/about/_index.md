# Hi, I'm Anubrat ðŸ‘‹

Born almost eight thousand days ago. Right now, I'm a junior year, Computer Science student at [Manipal Academy of Higher Education](https://www.manipal.edu/mu.html).

I genuinely love exploring Data Science and AI, as they offer mathematical insights. I enjoy experimenting with new ideas and techniques to solve complex problems. If I'm not working on a project, you might find me reading or writing something new.

If you want to get in touch, I'm most responsive over [email](mailto:anubratbora25@gmail.com) and I tend to be pretty active on [Twitter](https://x.com/anubrat25) as well.

Most recently, I have worked on building chatbots for a Chennai based startup, learnt the basics of Backend Development. I graduated high school from [Vivekananda Kendra Vidyalaya, Golaghat](https://golaghat.vkv.in), Assam, India, completing both my 10th and 12th grades. I have always had a strong inclination toward mathematics and problem-solving, which continues to this day. I'm enjoying my engineering studies as a Computer Science student and hope to collaborate with startups on various projects.
